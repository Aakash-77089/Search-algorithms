# Search Algorithms
This code represents the search algorithms in C++ 

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Search algorithms are methods used to find a specific item, solution, or path within a collection of data or a problem space.  
They are widely used in computer science, artificial intelligence, and data processing.

## ðŸ§  Types of Search Algorithms

### 1. **Uninformed Search (Blind Search)**
These algorithms do not have any additional information about the goal location beyond the problem definition.
- Examples:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Uniform Cost Search**
  - **Iterative Deepening Search**

### 2. **Informed Search (Heuristic Search)**
These algorithms use additional information (heuristics) to find the solution more efficiently.
- Examples:
  - **Greedy Best-First Search**
  - **A* Search Algorithm**
  - **Hill Climbing**
  - **Beam Search**

## ðŸ“Š Characteristics of Search Algorithms
- **Completeness** â€“ Will the algorithm always find a solution if one exists?
- **Optimality** â€“ Does it find the best possible solution?
- **Time Complexity** â€“ How much time does it take?
- **Space Complexity** â€“ How much memory does it require?

## âš¡ Applications
- Pathfinding in maps and games
- Solving puzzles (e.g., 8-puzzle, Sudoku)
- Web crawling and search engines
- Decision-making in AI systems
- Network routing
